I'm also an IOS developer who is self-taught in an overview of different languages and frameworks such as Swift, SwiftUI, UIKit, and Objective C. I enjoy Objective C programming language and building applications in Objective C since it's such a robust, strong language. I also enjoy Swift programming language with its much faster compiling time and technological advances. I'm also developing my skills in understanding UX / UI design.
